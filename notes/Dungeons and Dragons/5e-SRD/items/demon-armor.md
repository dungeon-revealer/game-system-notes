#### Demon Armor

*Armor (plate), very rare (requires attunement)*

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can understand and speak Abyssal. In addition, the armor’s clawed gauntlets turn unarmed strikes with your hands into magic weapons that deal slashing damage, with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls and a damage die of 1d8.

***Curse.*** Once you don this cursed armor, you can’t doff it unless you are targeted by the [*remove curse*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-remove-curse) spell or similar magic. While wearing the armor, you have disadvantage on attack rolls against demons and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities.
