#### Wand of Magic Missiles

*Wand, uncommon*

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the [*magic missile*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-magic-missile) spell from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wandâ€™s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
