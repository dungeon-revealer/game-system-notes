#### Belt of Giant Strength

*Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)*

While wearing this belt, your Strength score changes to a score granted by the belt. If your Strength is already equal to or greater than the beltâ€™s score, the item has no effect on you.

Six varieties of this belt exist, corresponding with and having rarity according to the six kinds of true giants. The *belt of stone giant strength* and the *belt of frost giant strength* look different, but they have the same effect.

| Type              | Strength | Rarity    |
|-------------------|----------|-----------|
| Hill giant        | 21       | Rare      |
| Stone/frost giant | 23       | Very rare |
| Fire giant        | 25       | Very rare |
| Cloud giant       | 27       | Legendary |
| Storm giant       | 29       | Legendary |
