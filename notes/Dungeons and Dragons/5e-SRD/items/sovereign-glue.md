#### Sovereign Glue

*Wondrous item, legendary*

This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with [*oil of slipperiness*](dnd-5e-srd-item-oil-of-slipperiness). When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.

One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of [*universal solvent*](dnd-5e-srd-item-universal-solvent) or [*oil of etherealness*](dnd-5e-srd-item-oil-of-etherealness), or with a [*wish*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-wish) spell.
