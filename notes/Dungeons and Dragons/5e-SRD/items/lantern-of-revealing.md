#### Lantern of Revealing

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

While lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible as long as they are in the lanternâ€™s bright light. You can use an action to lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5- foot radius.
