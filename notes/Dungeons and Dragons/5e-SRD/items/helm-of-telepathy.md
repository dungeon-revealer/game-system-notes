#### Helm of Telepathy

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the [*detect thoughts*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-detect-thoughts) spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain concentration on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply—using a bonus action to do so—while your focus on it continues.

While focusing on a creature with [*detect thoughts*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-detect-thoughts), you can use an action to cast the [*suggestion*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-suggestion) spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that creature. Once used, the [*suggestion*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-suggestion) property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
