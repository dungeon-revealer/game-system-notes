#### Necklace of Adaptation

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have advantage on saving throws made against harmful gases and vapors (such as [*cloudkill*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-cloudkill) and [*stinking cloud*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-stinking-cloud) effects, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).
