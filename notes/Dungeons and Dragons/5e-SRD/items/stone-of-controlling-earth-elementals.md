#### Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals

*Wondrous item, rare*

If the stone is touching the ground, you can use an action to speak its command word and summon an earth elemental, as if you had cast the [*conjure elemental*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-conjure-elemental) spell. The stone canâ€™t be used this way again until the next dawn. The stone weighs 5 pounds.
