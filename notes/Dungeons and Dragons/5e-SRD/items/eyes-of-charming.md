#### Eyes of Charming

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the [*charm person*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-charm-person) spell (save DC 13) on a humanoid within 30 feet of you, provided that you and the target can see each other. The lenses regain all expended charges daily at dawn.
