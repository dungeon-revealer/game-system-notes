#### Staff of Frost

*Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*

You have resistance to cold damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [*cone of cold*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-cone-of-cold) (5 charges), [*fog cloud*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-fog-cloud) (1 charge), [*ice storm*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-ice-storm) (4 charges), or [*wall of ice*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-wall-of-ice) (4 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff turns to water and is destroyed.
