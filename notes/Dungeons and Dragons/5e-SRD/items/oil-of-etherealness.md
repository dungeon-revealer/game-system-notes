#### Oil of Etherealness

*Potion, rare*

Beads of this cloudy gray oil form on the outside of its container and quickly evaporate. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment itâ€™s wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the [*etherealness*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-etherealness) spell for 1 hour.
