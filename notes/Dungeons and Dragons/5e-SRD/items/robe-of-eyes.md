#### Robe of Eyes

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

This robe is adorned with eyelike patterns. While you wear the robe, you gain the following benefits:
- The robe lets you see in all directions, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
- You have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.
- You can see invisible creatures and objects, as well as see into the Ethereal Plane, out to a range of 120 feet.

The eyes on the robe canâ€™t be closed or averted. Although you can close or avert your own eyes, you are never considered to be doing so while wearing this robe.

A [*light*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-light) spell cast on the robe or a [*daylight*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-daylight) spell cast within 5 feet of the robe causes you to be blinded for 1 minute. At the end of each of your turns, you can make a Constitution saving throw (DC 11 for [*light*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-light) or DC 15 for [*daylight*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-daylight)), ending the blindness on a success.
