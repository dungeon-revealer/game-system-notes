#### Potion of Heroism

*Potion, rare*

For 1 hour after drinking it, you gain 10 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour. For the same duration, you are under the effect of the [*bless*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-bless) spell (no concentration required). This blue potion bubbles and steams as if boiling.
