#### Staff of Power

*Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.

The staff has 20 charges for the following properties. The staff regains 2d8 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regains 1d8 + 2 charges.

***Power Strike.*** When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d6 force damage to the target.

***Spells.*** While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: [*cone of cold*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-cone-of-cold) (5 charges), [*fireball*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-fireball) (5th-level version, 5 charges), [*globe of invulnerability*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-globe-of-invulnerability) (6 charges), [*hold monster*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-hold-monster) (5 charges), [*levitate*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-levitate) (2 charges), [*lightning bolt*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-lightning-bolt) (5th-level version, 5 charges), [*magic missile*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-magic-missile) (1 charge), [*ray of enfeeblement*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-ray-of-enfeeblement) (1 charge), or [*wall of force*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-wall-of-force) (5 charges).

***Retributive Strike.*** You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.

You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

| Distance from Origin  | Damage                                 |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 10 ft. away or closer | 8 × the number of charges in the staff |
| 11 to 20 ft. away     | 6 × the number of charges in the staff |
| 21 to 30 ft. away     | 4 × the number of charges in the staff |
