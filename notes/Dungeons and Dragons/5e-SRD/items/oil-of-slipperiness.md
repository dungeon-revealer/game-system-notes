#### Oil of Slipperiness

*Potion, uncommon*

This sticky black unguent is thick and heavy in the container, but it flows quickly when poured. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment itâ€™s wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of a [*freedom of movement*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-freedom-of-movement) spell for 8 hours.

Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating the effect of the [*grease*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-grease) spell in that area for 8 hours.
