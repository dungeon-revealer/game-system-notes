#### Wand of Web

*Wand, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the [*web*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-web) spell (save DC 15) from it.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wandâ€™s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
