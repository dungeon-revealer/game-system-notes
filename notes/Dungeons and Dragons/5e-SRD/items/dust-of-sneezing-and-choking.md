#### Dust of Sneezing and Choking

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

Found in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand. It appears to be [*dust of disappearance*](dnd-5e-srd-item-dust-of-disappearance), and an [*identify*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-identify) spell reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.

When you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is incapacitated and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The [*lesser restoration*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-lesser-restoration) spell can also end the effect on a creature.
