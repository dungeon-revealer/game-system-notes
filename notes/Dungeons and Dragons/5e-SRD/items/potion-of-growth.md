#### Potion of Growth

*Potion, uncommon*

When you drink this potion, you gain the “enlarge” effect of the [*enlarge/reduce*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-enlarge-reduce) spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion’s liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
