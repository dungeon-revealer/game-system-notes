#### Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals

*Wondrous item, rare*

While this bowl is filled with water, you can use an action to speak the bowl’s command word and summon a water elemental, as if you had cast the [*conjure elemental*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-conjure-elemental) spell. The bowl can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.

The bowl is about 1 foot in diameter and half as deep. It weighs 3 pounds and holds about 3 gallons.
