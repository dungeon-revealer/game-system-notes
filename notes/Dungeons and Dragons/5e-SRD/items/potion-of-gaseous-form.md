#### Potion of Gaseous Form

*Potion, rare*

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the [*gaseous form*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-gaseous-form) spell for 1 hour (no concentration required) or until you end the effect as a bonus action. This potionâ€™s container seems to hold fog that moves and pours like water.
