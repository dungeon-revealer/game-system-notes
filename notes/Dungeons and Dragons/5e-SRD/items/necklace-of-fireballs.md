#### Necklace of Fireballs

*Wondrous item, rare*

This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level [*fireball*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-fireball) spell (save DC 15).

You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the [*fireball*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-fireball) by 1 for each bead beyond the first.
