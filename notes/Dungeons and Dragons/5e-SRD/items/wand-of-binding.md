#### Wand of Binding

*Wand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

This wand has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wandâ€™s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.

***Spells.*** While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17): [*hold monster*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-hold-monster) (5 charges) or [*hold person*](dnd-5e-srd-spell-hold-person) (2 charges).

***Assisted Escape.*** While holding the wand, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and gain advantage on a saving throw you make to avoid being paralyzed or restrained, or you can expend 1 charge and gain advantage on any check you make to escape a grapple.
