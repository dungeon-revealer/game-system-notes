#### Protection from Evil and Good

*1st-level abjuration*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Concentration up to 10 minutes

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also canâ€™t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.
