Here is a showcase of the interesting ways members of our community are using dungeon-revealer. If you want us to feature your project using dungeon-revealer, please contact us!

## Tabletop TV
[hinjodragonfly](https://github.com/hinjodragonfly) has created a case for a television that sits on the tabletop. There is a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) in the case running dungeon-revealer and presenting the player view on the screen. The DM page is accessed with a tablet.

## Tabletop Simulator Mod
[azzco](https://github.com/azzco) has made a [Tabletop Simulator mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2164161399) that projects the player view onto the table background. Players can also view the map through the in-game tablets.

## Bikers Dice and Bars Podcast
The [Bikers Dice and Bars podcast](https://breakfastpuppies.com/podcasts/bikersdicebars) by [nonplayer](https://github.com/nonplayer) released an [episode about virtual tabletops](https://breakfastpuppies.com/podcast-feeds/bdab-bonus-virtual-tabletops-w-alex-hakobian/). They compare various VTTs and feature dungeon-revealer in their "offline VTT" section.
