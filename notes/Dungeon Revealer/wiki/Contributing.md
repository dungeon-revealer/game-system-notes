The files for the wiki are kept in the [wiki](https://github.com/dungeon-revealer/dungeon-revealer/tree/master/wiki) folder of the [dungeon-revealer repository](https://github.com/dungeon-revealer/dungeon-revealer/).
To edit the wiki, you can [fork the repository](https://github.com/dungeon-revealer/dungeon-revealer/fork), make changes, and then open a pull request.
It's the same process as if you were making changes to the code.


You can also do all of this on the github website itself.
Simply navigate to the [wiki](https://github.com/dungeon-revealer/dungeon-revealer/tree/master/wiki) folder, open the file you wish to edit, and click on the edit button.
Github will take care of the fork and pull request processes for you.
