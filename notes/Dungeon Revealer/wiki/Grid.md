A grid helps to align tokens added to the map and can be used to easily reveal portions of the map. Any token with size `1x` added to a map with a grid will default to the grid size.

## Creating the grid

Click on the `Add Grid` button at the bottom to open the grid configuration menu.

Confirm adding a grid and adjust the grid size to match one square of your map. You can increase or decrease the grid size using the Column Width and Column Height boxes. Use the X-and-Y coordinates boxes to align the grid with your map, or press ALT and drag the grid on the map using your mouse.
